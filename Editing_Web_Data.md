## Prepare Data for Editing

- Need to prepare the data for editing by enabling editing directly on the feature layer.
- You can decide if you want to update geometry updates or just the layer attributes themselves.
- You can also decide if you want to add, change, or delete data.

## Editing Components

- You can bring in the editor component directly.  
  - But what if you want to do this displaying a feature service in OpenLayers, Leaflet, or Google Maps?

## Editor

### Things that it can do

- Attachments
- Editor
- FeatureForm
- FeatureTable
- FeatureTemplates
- SnappingControls
- Sketch
- â€¦and more!

Custom Editing can use Layer.applyEdits()

## What's New?

- Draw Tools & toolbar
- Two-dimensional grid that you can snap to with dynamic scaling.
