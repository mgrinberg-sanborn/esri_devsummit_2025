# Indoor Mapping for Mobile

I attended this because I couldn't attend the indoor mapping w/ Javascript presentation (conflict with another presentation), but it was still good.

## Intro

- CAD or BIM files are the most common way of getting this stuff.

## Levels in Indoor Mapping

- Site (Campus)
- Facility (building)
- Level (floor)
- Units (Rooms) & Details (Walls/Floors/Furniture)

- ArcGIS can use Lidar scans to create floor plans, but it can also use CAD or BIM. This creates an indoor dataset, which can then be used to create a floor-aware map.

## Creating Web and Mobile Apps

- **Web Map** has feature service & map service (online layers).
- **Mobile Map** can have offline and online layers.

## Demos

- Two demos: one with indoor maps and routing for Android (used VSCode for this), and iOS used Xcode.

## Additional Features

- You need to add a floor filter for the data.
- Can add a compass.

## Question

- **React Native?**  
  - They are trying to get this on the roadmap.
