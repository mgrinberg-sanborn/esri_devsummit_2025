# Notes for Future Attendees

- Dodgeball is great, you should do it. Be patient, aim for their top player.
- Leave presentations if they seem non-interesting/relevant, you can always jump to another one and many people do.
- Check out ESRI Dev events in the day or two before the summit to confirm the presentations you want to go to (can look at repos and slides in there in many cases)
- Try to go to non-recorded presentations, the recordings are very good.
